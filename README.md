Star Rating (Google Polymer based component)

This is a polymer based component. I call it 'star-rating'.

Usage:

```<star-rating></star-rating>```

Output:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```
Options:
*    max-rating: Max rating a user can give. Default value is 5.
*    user-rating: Default user rating is 0. It is in sync with user rating or rating given by the user.
